# Todo

To start your Phoenix server:

Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000/graphql`](http://localhost:4000/graphql) from your browser, have a look at the docs section in Graphiql and start querying the API with the right graphql queries.
